# Football
Android/desktop 2d game. Written on LibGDX

There are several balls on the field. Their number is constantly increasing during the game. Football balls are reflected from the boundaries of the field and from the board. Moving a board with a touch screen (in the desktop version - a mouse), you do not have to let the balls fall into the gate. The longer the player will endure - the more points he earns.
